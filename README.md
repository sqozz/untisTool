# untisTool
untisTool is a helper to export untis schedules into a caldav server.
"Untis" is a tool for schools/universities where they can manage and publish their schedules for their students.

## Who can use this?
Since untisTool uses the official API of Untis (with the help of python-webuntis) and an generic carddav module,
it should work with every instance of every school which has enabled api access for their students and should also
sync with every carddav server out their. But keep in mind: I've only access to one instance to test this code with.
If you find any problems with your instance of untis or caldav, please consider reporting them.
Maybe we can find a solution for that.
